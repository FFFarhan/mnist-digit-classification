# MNIST Digit Classifier

This project is an artificial neural network (ANN)-based solution for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries for model development and training.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
- Building, training, and evaluating a deep learning model for digit classification
- Saving and loading the trained model for future use
- Visualizing the training history and model predictions

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-digit-classifier.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Train, Evaluate, Make Predictions for the Model:**
Open the mnist-digit-classification.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and follow the steps provided to train the digit classifier model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new digit images.
